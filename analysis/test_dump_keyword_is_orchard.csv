"CookieQ is a hosted service that can helps website publishers manage user consent or permissions across multiple web domains. Customers can configure it so that users are presented with a cookie ""opt-in"" panel or button and optional reminder banner to website visitors. CookieQ was the original solution released in May 2011 to the requirement for consent to cookies laid out in Regulation 6 of the Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations 2011. The product has been enhanced with feedback from customers and now offers a complete consent platform capable of meeting any compliance requirements for consent management and communication. See our website at http://cookieq.com

Data used to register consent such as current state, revocation period etc. is stored entirely within the user’s browser and not simply in a domain specific cookie. Action on consent refusal in certain categories such as cookie and local storage removal can be entirely handled by CookieQ, so that no cookie placement is required, or alternatively session cookies can be used to signal consent status to particular web domain servers. Cookies or local storage used “strictly to support a service requested by the user” do not need to be automatically removed.

This platform can be configured either to offer an explicit opt-in mechanism whereby cookies & local storage are removed from their browser if the visitor has not opted in for particular customer defined or standard categories, or as an ""implied consent"" mechanism where cookies will not be removed by default but visitors can explicitly withdraw their consent whenever they wish. 

The styling and text of buttons and panels is completely configurable by the user, although various pre-baked styles are offered. Customers can design their own panels and banners retaining the look & feel of their website’s branding using standard techniques such as declarative HTML or using JavaScript libraries such as jQuery, or we can design these User Interface elements for them. 

The service can be configured so that a user visiting a website with the W3C standard Do Not Track header signal set in their browser will be given a specific default such as Tracking=no, overriding any implied consent if that is in operation. Analytics services such as Google Analytics are specifically supported whereby they can continue to be used without the need to collect user identifying data or enable it to be sent to a third party not under the jurisdiction of European Data Protection or Privacy law. 

Once consent has been obtained it can be applied across any number of web domains owned by the same data controller. This means that if the Government explains a single privacy and cookie storage policy to a visitor a positive indication of consent will immediately be available to the servers of all its other website domains. 

A ""dashboard"" feature allows the customer to manage the consent settings on all its websites instantly without needing to take down servers, and only needs to install a single line script snippet on every site. Implicit, explicit or no consent can be controlled by the dashboard or by automatic geo-location based on the visitor's source IP address. 


The CookieQ audit service 

The audit scanner is a cloud resident service that executes a spider scan of a site’s pages in order to generate an exhaustive and detailed  report of 1st party & 3rd party HTTP cookies (both those generated by set-cookies headers and JavaScript), Adobe “flash” cookies, localStorage usage and other site specific information. The report is formatted as an HTML document and emailed to the customer.
