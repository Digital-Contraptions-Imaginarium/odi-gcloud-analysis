We help government deliver better services for citizens by meeting challenging objectives.
 

Public sector business is a major part of our UK revenues. So our people’s capabilities are firmly focused on the public sector agenda, and on the distinctive needs of each organisation. 

Our impact on UK citizens’ lives is pervasive, important and growing. 

We manage more than 50% of all referrals for initial hospital and clinic appointments in England via our Choose and Book Service . We support more than 30 million MOT tests each year for VOSA . We process 50 million customer interactions a year for NS&I and we support 6.4 million people to complete their tax return online.

We integrate data from other cloud-based systems with expertise in many different APIs, data sources and formats, including RSS, XML, JSON, SOAP and REST. 

For clients who need to create their own cloud-based applications we can develop small-scale, custom PHP web and mobile-web applications. These projects normally combine development services with our agile web project management, user-interface design and information architecture consulting.

All our development work uses object-oriented PHP, with a preference for MVC frameworks such as Zend Framework and CodeIgnitor. For projects with a cloud-based content management component, we specialise in the SilverStripe open-source web content management system (CMS) and MVC framework (see www.silverstripe.org).

And provides a platform for big data repository and analysis. It is the basis for enablement of e-Government allowing collaboration and re-use of the existing systems/processes and the orchestration of new services/business processes. APIs are exposed in a controlled and secure manner. Data access is provided without ever having to open up databases to networks or the cloud. One of the key initiatives that can be supported is open data – making public sector data accessible on the internet through a secure and manageable process. Data Services support a number of business use cases including: * Open Data * Enterprise Application Integration * Master Data Management * Operational Intelligence * Content Management/Electronic Data Management * Mobile and Web Applications The embedded MongoDB database supports a NoSQL model to deliver highly flexible, high performance and scalable data management platform in support of agile service delivery, mobile application delivery and web application delivery.

Important consideration is that at the termination (or end of 1 or 2 year call-off contract term) the customer owns the data and the applications.

It is used by various national governments and public institutions around the world, like data.gov.uk, data.gov, and the EU open data portal (see also www.ckan.org/instances). WHY CKAN? Some core characteristics make it a perfect choice for any public sector institution: CKAN.org is a community-based open source project and the source code is AGPL v3 licensed. This open approach assures users maximum room for manoeuvre in the future, protects their investment and prevents vendor lock-in. CKAN’s architecture is highly modular: components and extensions allow the system to be customized to your needs. Developers can easily extend its functionality without the need to understand the whole system. In addition, CKAN offers a rich RESTful API (using JSON representations) that exposes all of CKAN’s core functionality to external client applications using only open web standards. Finally, CKAN adheres to open standards ensuring interoperability like INSPIRE, OGC CSW, metadata based on DCAT, as well as HTML and web services based on REST. FEATURES. CKAN supports publishers and data re-users alike. Publishers benefit from easy metadata management, workflow and approval support, user authorization, the reporting of broken links, and analytics and use stats. Re-users benefit from a long list of search and discovery features, like powerful search/filtering incl. “following” datasets, faceted browsing by tags/publishers/keywords/etc., a data explorer that allows preview, inspection and basic graphing for many types of data. In addition, CKAN offers INSPIRE-compliant geospatial capabilities like geo-search, map visualization, and metadata schemas (ISO19139, Gemini2.1, CSW); harvesting and normalization of metadata from other catalogs/servers from a variety of servers (CKAN, ArcGIS, Geoportal, Z39.50, WAF, CSW); data catalog interoperability (Data Catalog Interoperability Protocol) allowing search across different catalogs; multilingual support. SERVICE. If you are running a CKAN-based open data portal, we can offer the full range of support services: from general maintenance and support up to bespoke development of extensions (, e.g., dashboards or visualisations) and customizations tailored to your needs. Technical support days may be bought individually at £890 / day (including both project management and collaborative technical support) or in blocks of 10 days-plus (usable within 12 months) at £8,300 per 10-day block. Support days may include for example: Consultancy / advice – on data portals, functionality and open data policy; Custom development – for example, integrating with another service, development of new features, customisation of input forms and schemas, and site theming; Support / upgrades – technical support for CKAN and upgrades to new versions; Bug fixing – quickly resolving any issues with your deployment. As all core maintainers of CKAN are working for the Open Knowledge Foundation, we can provide the complete technical know-how about CKAN in-house. Instead of a trial/free option, you can always approach the CKAN community directly online with your questions/requests.

Deloitte will help departments to deliver this by capturing a clear understanding of their data's current availability and the actions needed to increase that availability. This may be used to assist portfolio planning or support business case development. The White Paper stated a principle that organisations should “Release data quickly, and then work to make sure that it is available in open standard formats, including linked-data forms.” The industry standard for measuring data availability is the 'Five Stars of Linked Open Data', specified by Sir Tim Berbers-Lee. The pinnacle of availability is considered to be a 5 star 'linked data' rating which indicates that the data is both available and is already linked to other data sources; allowing it to be easily exploited to generate insight. It may not be practical or good value for money to attempt to make all of an organisation's data meet this standard. To make meaningful progress, each department will need to understand where their gaps are, the ones to focus on that will drive the greatest value and the practical steps they can take to resolve these gaps. Deloitte will guide the client through this process, using a standardised approach, drawing on our extensive experience of data quality, data management and data transformation.

It helps to define the organisational objectives and need as well the various touch/transition points that will be required to undertake the evolution of the current state of Business, Application, Infrastructure and Data architectures to their required target state. Enterprise Blueprints offer a range of output based Agile Technical Architecture, Enterprise Architecture, Technical Strategy and Solution Architecture packages that offer very practical and conformant solutions with excellent Value For Money (VFM). These products are designed to support development of HM Treasury business cases and take account of HMG IT Strategy including GDS’s implementation policy. The scope of the ‘Initial Assessment’ package comprises tailored elements of: • IT Landscape review including options for consolidation, rationalisation and modernisation • Assessment of business architecture maturity • High level assessment of alignment between business and technical/solution architectures • High level assessment of security and compliance architecture • Review of transition from available ‘as-is’ to ‘to-be’ architectures including the use of open source and open standards to address cost and vendor lock-in • The use of modern infrastructure architectures to enable green IT and flexible service provision through cloud based solutions • The development of an assessment of the alignment between the business, technical architectures and the overarching information management strategy and information architecture which could enable provision of open data and use of big data Package delivery is within 4 weeks of commissioning and is based on the assumption that there will be requisite access to client information and parties. An accelerated delivery option can be offered but would attract a 10 to 20% premium depending on circumstances. The results of the assessment can be delivered in a presentation style, or as a formal report depending on the buyers need. The package will include a fixed price, outcome based proposal that provides options to secure the ‘next stage’ work-package and identify a tailored approach to addressing relevant issues for the business.

Enterprise Blueprints use a blend of experienced consultants and a range of highly competent and innovative architects to ensure products are qualitatively sound and have practical relevance. Every package will benefit from the use of industry leading methods, aligning to the Agile agenda, standardised processes and tooling that are integrated within an accredited quality management system, including: • Strong governance which will be linked to the Client’s to ensure proper control • Industry standard architecture frameworks such as TOGAF, ITIL V3 • Qualified and competent in EA practice(s) evidenced by TOGAF and ITIL Certification and knowledgeable on HMG processes, governance and strategy implementation • Tooling that is available ‘on demand’ and is extensible for client use Each client will have a senior EB architect assigned as being responsible for all aspects of their account and direct access to an Enterprise Blueprints board member in the unlikely event that escalation is necessary.",,,,,,,,,,,,Yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,No,Yes,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,No,,Yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,No,,,,Yes,No,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,Yes,No,,,,,,,Fixed Price Package (Price excluding VAT),,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,http://assets-production.govstore.service.gov.uk/G4/Enterprise_Blueprints-0885/523f377f35406730251a5493/QD1/Agile Enterprise Architecture-Initial Assessment Package Service Definition v1.pdf,http://assets-production.govstore.service.gov.uk/G4/Enterprise_Blueprints-0885/523f377f35406730251a5493/QD3/EB SFIA Rate Card v3.pdf,http://assets-production.govstore.service.gov.uk/G4/Enterprise_Blueprints-0885/523f377f35406730251a5493/QD4/EB Fixed Price Package Pricing Document.pdf,,,,,,http://assets-production.govstore.service.gov.uk/G4/Enterprise_Blueprints-0885/523f377f35406730251a5493/QD2/EB Terms and Conditions.pdf,agile-enterprise-architecture-initial-assessment-package4-g4-0885-001,AGILE ENTERPRISE ARCHITECTURE - INITIAL ASSESSMENT PACKAGE,"24,900.00 Fixed Price Package (Price excluding VAT)",4.G4.0885.001,"123, Pall MallSW1Y 5EALondonUnited Kingdom",bhuvan.satwah@enterpriseblueprints.com,Bhuvan Satwah,0203 651 0377,,211017227,Enterprise Blueprints,GB930526540,www.enterpriseblueprints.com

http://govstore.service.gov.uk/cloudstore/cloud-consulting-by-zennor4-g3-0677-001,"At Zennor Consulting we provide specialist advice, by security cleared consultants with a track record of delivery within central and local government for organisations looking to adopt or integrate cloud based solutions, which are increasingly being supplied by G-Cloud suppliers. Business Analysis: At the very early stages we can assist with the project concept, seeking to ensure your concept is ""cloud ready"" and that important issues are understood, such as the business impact levels of data and any pre-existing platforms that might need to be integrated or supported. This leads on to requirements gathering, whilst both the spirit of G-Cloud and Agile ways of working do not embrace writing long lists of requirements up-front, there are still some important key criteria to get down on paper, such as business impact levels, estimated usage, integration requirements or ""must have"" functionality. Project Selection and Specification: Selection of providers via G-Cloud is becoming more straightforward, however we can still help in running sifting through the service definitions, accreditation status and pricing tables in order to help with long listing, short listing and any detail required to identify the provider that most suits your project needs. Design Authority: The cloud and G-Cloud open up a lot of opportunities regarding solutions, but the architecture within cloud solutions still needs to be defined correctly for any specific project and this is another area where we can help. This might involve meshing two or more cloud providers together, such as CDN and Web Hosting, designing in service separation so that services degrade gracefully under load or failure, or using cloud based testing and monitoring services to ensure the service scales as required. Whilst the cloud is often cited as a great way to ensure scalability (which it certainly is) you have to ""get it right"" and that's what we do. Design and Development: Security is always important and the move to cloud poses some new challenges, least of all persuading the doubters. We have a solid understanding of the government security frameworks and experience in delivering pragmatic solutions that ensure accreditors remain happy. We are vendor neutral, but strongly support Open Source Software (OSS) and are keen to both leverage and deliver Open Data. Transition Management: Moving onto the cloud will be exciting and challenging, we work with you to make sure that no one and nothing gets left behind, ensuring that you have plan to cover issues such as data migration, user training, testing, service changeover and decommissioning. This should also cover important issues such as planning for any future ""off boarding"" to make best use of the supplier diversity and flexibility offered by G-Cloud. Some recent feedback from a supplier we worked with on a high profile cloud project was ""You asked us some very hard questions, but you also had ideas and solutions for how we could respond""",,,,,,,,,,,,Yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,Yes,Yes,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,No,,Yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Day,,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Yes,,,,No,,,,Yes,No,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,Yes,No,,,,,,,Day,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,http://assets-production.govstore.service.gov.uk/G4/Zennor_Consulting-0677/51f978ca12a2fcb9e800150c/QD1/Zennor Consulting Service Definition.pdf,http://assets-production.govstore.service.gov.uk/G4/Zennor_Consulting-0677/51f978ca12a2fcb9e800150c/QD3/Zennor SFIA rate card.pdf,http://assets-production.govstore.service.gov.uk/G4/Zennor_Consulting-0677/51f978ca12a2fcb9e800150c/QD4/Zennor Consulting Pricing Document.pdf,,,,,,http://assets-production.govstore.service.gov.uk/G4/Zennor_Consulting-0677/51f978ca12a2fcb9e800150c/QD2/Zennor-GCloud-TermsConditions.pdf,cloud-consulting-by-zennor4-g3-0677-001,Cloud Consulting by Zennor,500.00 Day,4.G3.0677.001,Rosedown FarmTreswithian DownsTR14 0BPCamborneUnited Kingdom,dedwards@zennor.co.uk,David Edwards,1872306404,,536576002,Zennor Consulting,,www.zennor.co.uk

Where departments have identified candidate data Deloitte will design and deliver the change required. This may include delivery of infrastructure, tools, format transformation and data transformation. This change will be driven by the experience of our industry-leading experts in this field. The White Paper stated a principle that organisations should “Release data quickly, and then work to make sure that it is available in open standard formats, including linked-data forms.” The industry standard for measuring data availability is the 'Five Stars of Linked Open Data', specified by Sir Tim Berbers-Lee. The pinnacle of availability is consider to be a 5 star 'linked data' rating which indicates that the data is both available and is already linked to other data sources; allowing it to be easily exploited to generate insight. Whether it is the client's intention to transform to this level of maturity, or simply to make the data available on the web in its current form, Deloitte can scope, design and deliver the change needed.",,,,,,,,,,,,Yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Yes,Yes,Yes,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,No,,Yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Day,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Yes,,,,Yes,,,,Yes,Yes,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,Yes,Yes,,,,,,,per Resource-Day,,Yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,http://assets-production.govstore.service.gov.uk/G4/Deloitte_LLP-0642/5240167a3540672247b8c70d/QD1/D-G4-L4-238 Open Data Transformation.pdf,,http://assets-production.govstore.service.gov.uk/G4/Deloitte_LLP-0642/5240167a3540672247b8c70d/QD4/Deloitte Pricing - SFIA Ratecard - G-Cloud IV.pdf,http://assets-production.govstore.service.gov.uk/G4/Deloitte_LLP-0642/5240167a3540672247b8c70d/QD5/Deloitte_GCloudIV_Service Definition_Mandatory Information.pdf,,,,,http://assets-production.govstore.service.gov.uk/G4/Deloitte_LLP-0642/5240167a3540672247b8c70d/QD2/Deloitte_G_Cloud_IV_Standard Terms and Conditions.pdf,d-g4-l4-238-open-data-transformation4-g4-0642-304,D-G4-L4-238 Open Data Transformation,743.00 per Resource-Day,4.G4.0642.304,2 New Street SquareEC4A 3BZLondonUnited Kingdom,ict@deloitte.co.uk,Jo Mann,0207 303 0913|028 9053 1022,,364807771,Deloitte LLP,GB809707706,www.deloitte.co.uk

http://govstore.service.gov.uk/cloudstore/methods-getmapping-wms-collections-os-opendata4-g4-0328-218,"Getmapping WMS Collections (Web Map Service) allows geographic base map data to be streamed over the web. It can be used as a cost-effective and efficient way of giving a whole organisation access to high quality map data, without the need for large local copies of the datasets to maintain in-house. With Getmapping WMS Collections, an organisation can remove the need to store and maintain their own copies of base mapping which saves time and frees IT resources and costs. Getmapping ensures all base maps are up-to-date which means each user can rely on the service to display the latest maps. It also ensures continuity over an organisation as each user is viewing the same version of the map. Getmapping WMS Collections: OS OpenData provides access to all the Ordnance Survey raster base maps available as OS OpenData. They are as follows; OS MiniScale, OS 1:250,000 Scale Colour Raster, OS VectorMap District and OS StreetView. Getmapping also value-adds the datasets to provide faded and greyscale versions of the mapping. The OS OpenData WMS Collection is a popular streaming product for large and small organisations as it provides a range of useful map scales that can underpin critical business operations at a very low annual cost. Getmapping WMS Collections can be connected to any OGC-compliant software package, or any WMS-compatible API. It can also be used directly within a web browser. Popular compatible software includes Pitney Bowes MapInfo Professional, ESRI ArcGIS, Quantum GIS, CadCorp SIS, Gaia and Getmapping GIS, among others. All Getmapping WMS Collections offer a 99.9% or greater service uptime and typical map load speeds range from less than 1 second on a Broadband connection up to 5 seconds on a mobile internet connection. These may vary depending on an organisation’s connection.

http://govstore.service.gov.uk/cloudstore/cloud-consulting-by-zennor,"At Zennor Consulting we provide specialist advice, by security cleared consultants with a track record of delivery within central and local government for organisations looking to adopt or integrate cloud based solutions, which are increasingly being supplied by G-Cloud suppliers. 

Business Analysis: At the very early stages we can assist with the project concept, seeking to ensure your concept is ""cloud ready"" and that important issues are understood, such as the business impact levels of data and any pre-existing platforms that might need to be integrated or supported.  This leads on to requirements gathering, whilst both the spirit of G-Cloud and Agile ways of working do not embrace writing long lists of requirements up-front, there are still some important key criteria to get down on paper, such as business impact levels, estimated usage, integration requirements or ""must have"" functionality.

Project Selection and Specification: Selection of providers via G-Cloud is becoming more straightforward, however we can still help in running sifting through the service definitions, accreditation status and pricing tables in order to help with long listing, short listing and any detail required to identify the provider that most suits your project needs.

Design Authority: The cloud and G-Cloud open up a lot of opportunities regarding solutions, but the architecture within cloud solutions still needs to be defined correctly for any specific project and this is another area where we can help. This might involve meshing two or more cloud providers together, such as CDN and Web Hosting, designing in service separation so that services degrade gracefully under load or failure, or using cloud based testing and monitoring services to ensure the service scales as required. Whilst the cloud is often cited as a great way to ensure scalability (which it certainly is) you have to ""get it right"" and that's what we do.

Design and Development: Security is always important and the move to cloud poses some new challenges, least of all persuading the doubters. We have a solid understanding of the government security frameworks and experience in delivering pragmatic solutions that ensure accreditors remain happy. We are vendor neutral, but strongly support Open Source Software (OSS) and are keen to both leverage and deliver Open Data. 

Transition Management: Moving onto the cloud will be exciting and challenging, we work with you to make sure that no one and nothing gets left behind, ensuring that you have plan to cover issues such as data migration, user training, testing, service changeover and decommissioning. This should also cover important issues such as planning for any future ""off boarding"" to make best use of the supplier diversity and flexibility offered by G-Cloud.
