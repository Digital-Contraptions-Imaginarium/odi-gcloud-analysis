   <td> Gap Analysis </td>
   <td> Gap analysis works by identifying the maturity level of a client's communications systems; these may be embryonic, comprising only basic voice functions and other simple features, or at the advanced end of the spectrum, utilising intelligent interactive voice response (IVR) menus and other developed call routing features.

Having completed this initial analysis, Content Guru consultants  assess where the business currently stands in terms of communications technology and maturity. The next step is to determine where the client would like to be, which allows the consultancy team to make an objective assessment of the extent of the gap between the current situation and the objective.

A plan can then be drawn up of how Content Guru solutions can take a business from its present maturity level and improve this to the desired maturity level, identifying with relevance to the market the specific features and aspects of infrastructure that can be worked on. This information is compiled into a report which is then presented to the client. Once an agreement is reached, the solutions can be implemented.

   <td> CGI - Spectrum Management Tools as a Service </td>
   <td> The radio spectrum is a highly sought-after resource. Emergency services, broadcasters, military, transport, science... Government related users of electromagnetic spectrum are many and varied. And in the modern, connected, world this wireless resource is also the lifeblood of much commercial innovation, generating estimated benefits to UK worth over £40bn each year. But spectrum costs money and it is in short supply, which makes it a valuable asset. So, in a technology driven society, how do you balance the need to provide vital public services with the need to control costs, increase revenues and stimulate growth? Often organisations need to acquire more spectrum, use the spectrum they have more effectively, or even trade some of their existing spectrum rights. In particular, target-driven pressures on Government organisations are increasing. There is an increasing need for services to be scalable as business demands change, and available reliably and securely to users with different authorisation levels wherever they are. This is certainly the case for spectrum management. The range of data and processes required, and their inter-relationships with operations and strategic decision-making, means that a flexible approach is essential. This requires systems and networks that are robust and trusted. Information must be managed in accordance with good practice and it is important to be able to restore operations rapidly in a recovery situation. These requirements mean that spectrum management will become increasingly dependent on delivery through Cloud services. In order to thrive in this rapidly changing business and technological environment, whether services are Cloud-based or not, it is essential that organisations possess effective spectrum management capabilities that balance a number of factors: • The need for a strong strategic direction; • Ensuring necessary spectrum is available; • Meeting business needs; • Compliance with legislation and targets; • Enabling efficient operations; • Controlling spectrum costs; • Sharing and protecting information in systems. To enable organisations to achieve this balance, CGI offers a Spectrum Management Tool Software as a Service and a range of supporting consultancy specialisms. This capability, jointly developed with the UK Ministry of Defence, is based on many years of experience in delivering mission critical information enabled capabilities. CGI is ideally placed to build upon the lessons learnt from the UK MOD Defence Spectrum Reform Programme. Our experience over the last ten years of developing Spectrum based solutions allows us to provide the necessary expertise, guidance and support to enable your organisation to adopt and implement high-quality, best-practice spectrum management. This is underpinned by accurate and assured information stored and managed in a Spectrum Management Tool provided as a service. We have taken the 'core' principals from the ITU Spectrum Management Regulations, Concepts and Doctrine from Ofcom (the UK regulatory), NATO Spectrum Management Branch and UK Ministry of Defence to develop a spectrum management tool specifically designed to support organisations that are responsible for managing their own spectrum holdings. The key differentiator of our spectrum management tool is the simplicity and ease-of-use as it hasn't been designed to conduct all the complex regulatory requirements, but instead focused on the key requirements of a Spectrum Band Manager. The portal provides a wide range of features, some of which are summarised below: • Users are able to administer a comprehensive set of spectrum data including assignments, user details, equipment characteristics, interference reports and locations. Users can choose between starting with an empty database for population, a database containing pre-populated test data, or migrate their own spectrum data via an on-boarding process. • An in-built mapping system helps users to visualise assignments geographically, allowing deconfliction and interference analysis. • Regulatory tools allow frequency allocation tables and restricted frequency lists to be factored in to assignment calculations. • Workflows, wizards and context sensitive help guide users through complex operations, such as creating new frequency assignments, to speed up performance of spectrum management tasks and lower the training burden for the tool. • Dashboards and metrics allow multiple spectrum managers to administrate the data simultaneously, with clear indicators of tasks that need their attention. • A reporting capability enables spectrum managers to see live, expiring and expired assignment counts and view frequency occupancy graphs. Evidence from the UK MOD Defence Spectrum Reform Programme and details of the recent DCMS target strategy to release 500 MHz of Public Sector Spectrum by 2020 illustrate the pressure that government departments will be under to demonstrate saving and efficiency gains. The recent Communications White Paper from DCMS also indicates the need for more Dynamic Spectrum Management and an increased level of sharing of spectrum both within government but also with the commercial market place. This target and strategy is also likely to bring with it a set of incentivisations, for example, wider use of Administrative Incentive Pricing. In order for government departments to be able to provide robust answers and justifications for their spectrum use they require a detailed and accurate description of their spectrum holdings along with the ability to generate visualisations and reports that articulate information to the key decision makers and influencers. Our Spectrum Management Tool offering provides exactly that – a government department level database and web based portal to allow spectrum holdings to be described and visualised in a common and consistent manner.
