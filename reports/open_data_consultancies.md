   <td> We have expertise in a range of middleware, integration and data management technologies including IBM WebSphere, SAP NetWeaver, Oracle Fusion, Microsoft BizTalk, Tibco/Staffware, Sun JCAPS (SeeBeyond) and Software AG (webMethods). We have a number of re-useable integration delivery tools (e.g. patterns) that enable us to accelerate the time to delivery whilst also reducing risk and cost of ownership. Service Integration In today’s IT environments there is a lot more emphasis on service orientated provision of technology solutions. This means that traditional point to point integration approach becomes less appropriate. Service Orientated Architecture and design are a good fit for organisations that wish to achieve vendor independence and utilise Cloud services more. Glue Reply has a strong track record in Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) and integration space and has in-depth knowledge of the following technologies: • Service Development OSB • Service Development WebSphere • Service Development Tibco • Service Development WebMethods Glue Reply’s Integration Excellence can help your organisation to: • Capitalise on the technology investments such as Enterprise Service Bus • Implement service-enabled integration to drive re-use and standardisation within the organisation • Promote underlying architectural patterns through the use of methods, frameworks and accelerators that ensure quality and speed of SOA deployment • Establish an integration centre of excellence within your organization using the Glue Reply Competency Centre Framework Our ethos of working closely with our clients to ‘coach’ as well as ‘consult’ means that once we complete the design and architecture, we work with you to ensure that you have all the right skills to keep Integration Excellence evolving. Integration Framework Design & Implementation Glue Reply has a concept of an Integration Factory. This concept has come about from many years of delivering successful projects and consists of a number of tools that enable software solutions to be designed and developed rapidly using our best practice templates. We are able to design and implement an Integration Framework that will be hosted within the existing customer environment and allows for development and sustainment organisations to consistently deliver and support solutions. The key components of the Integration Framework are: • Delivery Architecture: Tooling used to design, build, test and deploy solutions to the Runtime architecture. • Runtime Architecture: The execution platform for solutions including: Platform Framework Capabilities Overview, Customer specific Solution Patterns and Platform Framework Architecture • Functional Decomposition & Responsibilities • Component Interactions, including, Framework for delivering a Technical SOA Service, Framework for Building Adapters, Framework for Routing, Mediation & Orchestration, Management of Large File Transfers, Data Transformation, Security Design and Design Standards & Naming Conventions. • Service Management Architecture: The support environment for resolving in service and transition to service issues The Integration Framework will include repeatable and enduring components for building services, orchestrations, mediators and adapters allowing for: • Improved efficiency in service development • Consistent component design • Re-use of existing objects, designs Integration Factory Design & Implementation The provision of this capability will draw heavily on Glue Reply extant processes for delivering an Integration Factory. Glue Reply offers tailored versions of Glue Reply’s IP by the creation of a set of processes and documentation for use in the LogNEC programme. This work will be done in conjunction with the customer, and our assumption is that the deliverables are dependent on a collaborative engagement from the evolving Integration Factory. The outputs consist of a set of processes and documentation to allow the initiation, management and running of the Integration Factory and includes, Analysis and Design, Build and Test Processes, Release and Deployment, In service support, Document Templates, Product Breakdown, Analyst/Designer Guidelines, Developer Guidelines, Release Manager Guidelines and Project Manager Guidelines The Integration Factory consists of the following elements: • A suitably trained and experienced team covering all elements of the service lifecycle from identification to service management and support. • A development environment consisting of the tools required to support the design, build, deployment and testing of the integration factory. • A development method; a specialisation of which has been delivered to the Log NEC Programme previously and which forms the basis of the Log NEC ICC Framework. • A set of standards covering all aspects of the service lifecycle and in particular standard designs that can be matched to a business requirement and quickly instantiated. • Re-usable utility services that can accelerate to the time to deployment of a production ready solution. • Development and exploitation of a canonical data model to support standardised messaging. • Knowledge transfer to enable in-house team to up-skill and to provide support services. • Proven change management procedures with supporting templates and artefacts. The Integration Factory Methodology The Integration Factory method comprises the following phases: • Think and Plan Design - Identify & Profile, Architect & Model • Assemble using parallel Sub-Projects - Technical Design, Implementation, Functional Testing and Packaging • Assess & Evolve - Integration Test, Acceptance Test and Deployment and Handover In addition, there are a number of enabling services comprising; Project Management, Design Assurance, Change Management and Knowledge Management Glue Reply Experience & Capability Glue Reply is a leading independent architecture and integration specialist and has significant experience in delivering successful consultancy engagements for large-scale complex organisations.

   <td> User Experience (UX) Service </td>
   <td> User Experience (UX) Service Introduction Designing innovative cloud-based software applications and services with the user's interests at the heart, is often a lot harder than initially imagined. Many organisations have come to appreciate that they require specialist assistance to ensure that their innovation and user experience objectives can be realised without being overshadowed or constrained by the internal business and IT drivers. NTT DATA has extensive experience in helping organisations achieve these objectives from its market leading software application projects, where rapid levels of user adoption were a critical success factor. Unlike many design organisations, NTT DATA does not just focus on designing innovative and readily adopted software applications; it delivers the designed solutions into the customer's real world environment. Our approach is centred on having design and development capabilities working in integrated teams (pods) throughout the project, ensuring a careful balance of the technical/functional and user experience considerations at all times. Services The objective of the User Experience (UX) service is to assist clients in undertaking a thorough and structured exploration of the critical needs of the users, taking into account the objectives of the business and any existing delivery technology preferences. This captured insight is then used to design a deliverable user experience and the structured user interfaces necessary to achieve these requirements. The output sets the road map for development activities in the later delivery phases. The service focuses on exploring, analysing, capturing and prioritising the user experience requirements and designing the user interface required to deliver the highest value elements of interactive functionality quickly and efficiently. This may be via the client's internal development team or with assistance from NTT DATA. To deliver a good and innovative experience for the user, the solution design must focus on both the interface and the experience. The core components can be broken down as follows: - Visual Design - Information Design - Information Architecture - Interaction Design/User Research - Experience Strategy Achieving a good user experience, across multiple delivery channels is rarely achieved if the design is solely driven from the perspective of the visual polish alone. Whilst an application might meet all the internal look and feel requirements and appear visually attractive, it is the user's interaction with the solution and its support for the way that they really work day to day that sets 'appealing, but hard to use' apart from 'appealing and easy to use'. It is vitally important that we design applications considering both ends of this spectrum in a balanced manner, rather than a one-way process from top to bottom. Approach The service focuses on the user facing requirements of the proposed cloud-based solution. The size and shape of the work delivered will depend on the business problem(s) to be address. An early requirements review and prioritisation is used to keep the initial discovery and define/design phases to approximately six weeks of elapsed time (prior to work commencing on the highest priority areas of functionality). Dependent on the scale of the challenge, the project could then require up to ten weeks of further discovery and design work to cater for the rest of the programme. The service is split into two phases: a) Discovery and, b) Define and Design. a) Discovery Phase. During this Phase various techniques are used to facilitate the exploration, analysis, capture and prioritisation of the user experience requirements such as: - Desk research - Rapid Ethnography / contextual research (observing users in actual living or working environments) - Stakeholder Interviews (user, business and technology stakeholders) - User Interviews and workshops - Competitor and comparator reviews and benchmarking - Existing application usage analysis - Usage scenarios - User journey mapping - Persona creation - Value linkage diagram creation - Experience maps - High level concept sketches - Vision prototypes - Concept prioritisation - Technology landscape review - Technology road mapping - Spiking - Proof of concepts - Feasibility reviews The outputs from the Discovery Phase act as inputs for the define/design phase. A Discovery Report, which catalogues the activities and conclusions from the discovery phase, is produced to provide a rounded view of the relevant landscape and direction setting for the project. b) Define and Design Phase. During this phase, the requirements are further prioritised and the highest value concepts are further developed. The experience strategy is matured; initial interface designs for the solutions highest value capabilities are developed. Techniques used during this phase include: - User journey mapping - User Interface Concept sketching - Requirements management and user story creation - Screen flows modelling - Mood boarding - Visual brand exploration - Experience principles - Interaction principles - Visual language creation - Taxonomies - Conceptual experience architecture - Application map - Detailed process flows - Motion design - Iconography - Visual design and asset production - Wireframe creation - User testing and paper prototyping - Interaction prototyping - Output from the service Deliverables Various outputs are produced from the service which underpin the final concepts and design decisions. The catalogue of design assets and guides act as the road map for development, which is usually undertaken in an agile sprint-based approach. The outputs which act as the roadmap for development include but are not limited to: application maps, wireframes, interaction models, motion designs, iconology, visual assets and taxonomies. The approach provides the basis for starting development and delivery on key functionality as early as possible and development/design refinement is undertaken on a sprint basis thereby allowing for late stage requirements adjustment and design flexibility. This model provides for maximum flexibility and user involvement, whilst focusing on early delivery of value in an iterative manner.
