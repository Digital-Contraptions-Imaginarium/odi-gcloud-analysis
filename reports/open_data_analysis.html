<td align="left"><a href='http://govstore.service.gov.uk/cloudstore/data-services-as-a-service4-g4-0162-201'>Data Services as a Service</a></td>
<td align="left">The Data Services as a Service enables data stored in legacy/operational systems, in the cloud and on-premise, to be exposed as a web service and publish via the Cloud as an API. And provides a platform for big data repository and analysis. It is the basis for enablement of e-Government allowing collaboration and re-use of the existing systems/processes and the orchestration of new services/business processes. APIs are exposed in a controlled and secure manner. Data access is provided without ever having to open up databases to networks or the cloud. One of the key initiatives that can be supported is open data â€“ making public sector data accessible on the internet through a secure and manageable process. Data Services support a number of business use cases including: * Open Data * Enterprise Application Integration * Master Data Management * Operational Intelligence * Content Management/Electronic Data Management * Mobile and Web Applications The embedded MongoDB database supports a NoSQL model to deliver highly flexible, high performance and scalable data management platform in support of agile service delivery, mobile application delivery and web application delivery. Performance is improved by 20 times and storage requirements reduced by as much as 90%. Data Services as a Service includes a leading content management and workflow system that is based on open source technologies including Apache, PHP and Django. This has quickly become one of the leading CMS in the fashion industry. We have now adapted the solution for the G-Cloud and focus to bring solutions to the UK Public Sector. Important consideration is that at the termination (or end of 1 or 2 year call-off contract term) the customer owns the data and the applications. As this solution is built with open source there will be no on-going software maintenance fees or one time license costs in event the customer wishes to bring on-premise. With typical IT systems lifespan 7-10 years this represents a major cost advantage compared to proprietary software offerings.</td>

<td align="left">This service consists of the provision of data analytics to inform strategy and policy development. It is designed for organisations which collect or have access to a large volume of structured and unstructured data and wish to systematically analyse this in order to derive policy- and business-relevant insights. This service comprises of a range of bespoke analytical tools including business intelligence, data management, econometrics, geo-spatial and visualisation analyses. Deloitte would work with you to identify your exam question and how data analytics could be applied to derive new and valuable insights. These tools can be used across all sectors and departments, covering issues such as driving efficiencies, stimulating innovation, maximising value for money, achieving policy outcomes and identifying problems before they arise. These tools can draw on both open data and data held privately by organisations. The results can be encoded into easy-to-use visualisation tools that can be rolled out across organisations. This is designed as a one-off service whereby Deloitte would build the model/tool for the initial analysis and hand over to you for continuing maintenance and upgrading. The time frame for the service would vary according to your requirement, but could take at least six months - though this is highly contingent on data quality and the complexity of the exam question.</td>

<td align="left"><a href='http://govstore.service.gov.uk/cloudstore/cloud-consulting-by-zennor4-g3-0677-001'>Cloud Consulting by Zennor</a></td>
<td align="left">At Zennor Consulting we provide specialist advice, by security cleared consultants with a track record of delivery within central and local government for organisations looking to adopt or integrate cloud based solutions, which are increasingly being supplied by G-Cloud suppliers. Business Analysis: At the very early stages we can assist with the project concept, seeking to ensure your concept is &ldquo;cloud ready&rdquo; and that important issues are understood, such as the business impact levels of data and any pre-existing platforms that might need to be integrated or supported. This leads on to requirements gathering, whilst both the spirit of G-Cloud and Agile ways of working do not embrace writing long lists of requirements up-front, there are still some important key criteria to get down on paper, such as business impact levels, estimated usage, integration requirements or &ldquo;must have&rdquo; functionality. Project Selection and Specification: Selection of providers via G-Cloud is becoming more straightforward, however we can still help in running sifting through the service definitions, accreditation status and pricing tables in order to help with long listing, short listing and any detail required to identify the provider that most suits your project needs. Design Authority: The cloud and G-Cloud open up a lot of opportunities regarding solutions, but the architecture within cloud solutions still needs to be defined correctly for any specific project and this is another area where we can help. This might involve meshing two or more cloud providers together, such as CDN and Web Hosting, designing in service separation so that services degrade gracefully under load or failure, or using cloud based testing and monitoring services to ensure the service scales as required. Whilst the cloud is often cited as a great way to ensure scalability (which it certainly is) you have to &ldquo;get it right&rdquo; and that&#39;s what we do. Design and Development: Security is always important and the move to cloud poses some new challenges, least of all persuading the doubters. We have a solid understanding of the government security frameworks and experience in delivering pragmatic solutions that ensure accreditors remain happy. We are vendor neutral, but strongly support Open Source Software (OSS) and are keen to both leverage and deliver Open Data. Transition Management: Moving onto the cloud will be exciting and challenging, we work with you to make sure that no one and nothing gets left behind, ensuring that you have plan to cover issues such as data migration, user training, testing, service changeover and decommissioning. This should also cover important issues such as planning for any future &ldquo;off boarding&rdquo; to make best use of the supplier diversity and flexibility offered by G-Cloud. Some recent feedback from a supplier we worked with on a high profile cloud project was &ldquo;You asked us some very hard questions, but you also had ideas and solutions for how we could respond&rdquo;</td>
